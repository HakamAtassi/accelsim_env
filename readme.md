# Setup

Accel-sim has quite an unpleasant set up process. In order to get up and running, you will likely encouter a few issues that may result from an unset env variable causing the clone of the wrong repo, or an env variable being set that should no longer be set, and variety of other issues that are really annoying to debug. This repo helps streamline this process. 


Note: Towards the end of the set up process, when you run the SASS trace, you need to collect the trace using a system with the same GPU archtiecture as what you are simulating. I have an ampere GPU, so I set the variable to a RTX3070.
